# Standardized CART Utilities

This package contains a number of utilities or structures which have a common enough use case (or have an unintuitive/difficult implementation) to be standardized across most CART applications. This readme provides an overview of the notable utilities provided, with a brief description of each.

## BIDS Management

Placed within `bids.py`, provides utilities for handling data organized in the BIDS format. Notable functions include:

### `check_pseudo_bids` 

Validates that the passed directory is organized in a BIDS-like manner. Checks for the presence of at least one `sub-` directory, and a `derivatives` directory.
### `generate_blank_cohort`

Generate a cohort file template, with one case row per `sub-` directory within the provided path.

### `fetch_bids_subject_map`

Generates a map of case (subject) IDs to the files within the BIDS directory that should be associated with them.

## Configuration Management

Placed within `config.py`, this provides a number of standard structures for managing, saving, and loading configuration options in CART. Notable elements include:

### `DictBackedConfig`

As the name suggests, this is a configuration handled back by a Python dictionary. For it to work in the context of CART's profiles, it has two attributes of note:

* `parent`: Another `DictBackedConfig` that this config should be stored within. 
  * In most cases, this will be the currently active profile's configuration passed during task initialization, making this a "child" of that profile.
  * If you do not provide one, you need to override `save_without_parent` to define how this configuration should be saved!
* `config_label`: A label that the parent config will use to track this config within itself. Can be overridden by passing a different label during construction (see `ProfileConfig` in [`config.py`](config.py) for an example of when that may be warranted.)

By using this class as a configuration manager for your task, you get the following for free:

* Allows you to mark when its contents has changed, which hooks into the GUI component (see [`ConfigDialog`](#configdialog) below)
* Handles access to the backing dictionary and its contents, including lazily evaluated defaults with `get_or_default`.
  * For ease of access, we use Python `properties` to add/access configuration entries within the `_backing_dict` dictionary.
* Ensures configuration values are saved and loaded correctly throughout CART's runtime.

### `ConfigDialog`

An abstract QT Dialog class which provides common utilities for interacting with a bound `DictBackedConfig` instance. You should subclass this to build the GUI yourself, but doing so provides you the following for free:

* Standardized set of "reset", "confirm", and "cancel" buttons.
* "Are you sure?" confirmation prompt if the user tries to cancel out of the dialog with saved changes.
* Implicit synchronization with the state of CART and its current configuration settings.

## Data Handling

The functions within the `data.py` utility provide wrappers for common data I/O operations in Slicer, adjusted to work effectively in the context of CART's iterative framework. Most utilities also follow the "CART Standard Format" when they are parsing a cohort file; this format is detailed below:

### The CART Standard Format

All example tasks provided by CART follow the "CART Standard" for cohort formatting. This standard can be summarized as follows:

* Columns which contain `volume` are assumed to be a path to a volume file. 
  * The first such volume is made the "reference" volume for the case, with its co-ordinate system and orientation being used to place and orient all other volumes, segmentations, and markups.
* Columns which contain `segmentation` are assumed to be a path to a segmentation file.
* Columns which contain `markup` are assumed to be a path to a Slicer markup JSON file.

If you want your data unit to follow this standard (and load each column according to its detected type automatically), you can subclass the `CARTStandardUnit` to do so. If you want to follow the standard, but handling the loading of each file yourself, you can instead use the `parse_volumes`, `parse_segmentations`, and `parse_markups` functions to identify Volume, Segmentation, and Markup columns, respectively.

### Manual I/O Handling

If your Task needs your cohort to not follow the CART Standard Format, you should still consider using the following I/O utilities for reading/writing common file types. Most are wrappers for common Slicer I/O operations, modified (or with additional checks) to ensure they will run nicely within CART's iterative framework.

#### Volume I/O

Volumes can be loaded in any format currently supported by Slicer (except DICOM, due to its folder-based structure) via the `load_volume` function. Currently only supports saving volumes to _NiFTI_ format with `save_volume_to_nifti`.

#### Segmentation I/O

Like volumes, can load any format supported by Slicer. Can be loaded as a "label" (via `load_label`) or a "segmentation" (via `load_segmentation`). Label files are saving identically to volumes (with `save_volume_to_nifti`), with segmentations being saved using `save_segmentation_to_nifti` instead.

You can also create a "blank" segmentation using the `create_empty_segmentation_node` function; this can be useful for tasks where you want the user to create a segmentation themselves, rather than edit an existing one.

#### Markups I/O

Supports markups stored in the Slicer `.json` format; load with `load_markups`, save with `save_markups_to_json`. What is loaded/saved depends on the type of markup contained within the file; see [the official documentation](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/markups.html) for more details.

#### Node Grouping

To make managing each data unit's nodes easier, it's often easier to group them into a single "subject" that is hidden/revealed/deleted when needed (rather than doing so for each MRML node manually). If you have a list/set of nodes you want to group, you can use the `create_subject` to streamline this process.

## Slicer Layout Handling

The contents of `layout.py` are for handling how the nodes in a given case should be displayed to the user in the Slicer viewer. The majority of the time, all you will need from this utility is the `Orientation` flag and the `LayoutHandler` class.

### `Orientation`

This enum is used by CART to track what orientation(s) you want to be displayed to the user. It can be one of three "base" values:

* `AXIAL`: Represents the Axial plane
* `SAGITTAL`: Represents the Sagittal plane
* `CORONAL`: Represents the Coronal plane

The `Orientation` enum is a [flag-type enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.Flag); this allows us to "combine" orientations using the `|` operator. The resulting orientations are then treated as all the "base" orientations used to create it:

```python
>>> axial_and_coronal = Orientation.AXIAL | Orientation.CORONAL
>>> print(Orientation.AXIAL in axial_and_coronal) 
True
>>> print(Orientation.SAGITTAL in axial_and_coronal)
False
```

These "combined" orientations are used by the LayoutHandler (detailed below) to denote when the user wants multiple orientations displayed simultaneously; it is not bound to that use, however, and can be re-used in your own tasks as you see fit.

### `LayoutHandler`

Responsible for determining the best layout to display the set of volume nodes it resides over. To do so, it requires three things:

* A set of volume nodes that it should make displays for
* A "primary" volume node; this is used as the reference for the purposes of determining where overlays (segmentations and markups) will be displayed. 
  * If none is provided, the first segmentation node is used
* An `Orientation` object, containing the view orientation(s) that should be displayed.

It can then "apply" its layout to the Slicer scene; this results in 1 panel per volume node and "base" orientation combination. 

You can change the orientation post-init with the `set_orientation` function; this will invalidate the current layout XML, however, resulting in a new one being generated the next time the layout is applied to Slicer.


## Task Registration

The utils in `task.py` are mostly for registering custom CART task's post-initialization. In all likelihood, you will only need the `cart_task` decorate from this utility suite. It should be used to denote which class(es) within a Python file should be registered as valid CART tasks if CART attempts to register the file:

```python
from CARTLib.core.TaskBaseClass import TaskBaseClass
from CARTLib.utils.task import cart_task

@cart_task
MyCoolCustomTask(TaskBaseClass):
    ...
```

## Widgets

The contents of the `widgets.py` file are QT widget elements which fall into one of two classes:

* Existing Slicer widgets re-implemented to work better in the context of CART
* Widgets which interact directly with CART itself in a standardized way

Both can be re-used within your custom tasks as you see fit, or sub-classed further to extend/revise their behaviour.

### CARTSegmentationEditorWidget

A subclass of Slicer's `qMRMLSegmentEditorWidget`, with its functionality extended to work within the CART context. Specifically:

* The associated shortcuts and binds to the MRML scene are handled correctly as CART iterates through the case load.
* It respects changes to the `HideFromEditors` attribute for nodes post-init, unlike the original base class. This allows nodes to be "hidden" on the fly (which CART often does to "cache" data units without removing them from Slicer's memory)

However, please note the following differences from the original widget:

* It does not provide actions in its drop-downs, like those seen in the original subclass
* The `refresh` function is required for it to update its state to match changes in the MRML scene; you should do this automatically within the corresponding task after a new data unit is received to ensure it is properly synchronized.
