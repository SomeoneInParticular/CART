# Segmentation Review and Correction Task

This task allows for iterative review (and, if needed, correction) of image segmentations for a volume. To aid with this, you can load multiple volumes, other reference segmentations, and even file markups on a case-by-case basis as well. You can also use this to generate segmentation manually, should no segmentation exist currently exist for a case in the cohort.

# Creating a Cohort File

The cohort file for this can contain the following column types:

* **UID**: A label each case with a unique name/label. 
  * Only one **UID** column can exist, and it must be named `uid`.
  * Each case must have a valid **UID**.
* **Volume**: A filepath to an anatomical image, in NIfTI or NRRD format.
  * Any column with `volume` in its name is treated as a **Volume** column.
  * Each case must have at least one valid **Volume** entry; multiple are allowed as well.
* **Segmentation**: A filepath to a segmentation image, in NIfTI or NRRD format. 
  * Any column with `segmentation` in its name is treated as a **Segmentation** column.
  * Each case can have none, one, or multiple **Segmentation** entries.
* **Markup**: A filepath to a Slicer Markup JSON file. 
  * Any column with `markup` in its name is treated as a **Markup** column.
  * Each case can have none, one, or multiple **Markup** entries.

Which segmentation for a given case is determined to be the "primary" segmentation (and thus will be the segmentation you can edit and save) is determined as follows:

1. The first (left to right) Segmentation column with a valid filepath with `primary` in its name is chosen.
2. Failing that, the first Segmentation column with a valid filepath is chosen
3. If that fails, then the task assumes you want to _create_ a new segmentation, and generates a "blank" segmentation in Slicer instead.

Some examples of valid cohort files (and how they will be loaded into CART) are provided below for your reference.

# Example Cohort Files

Below are examples of valid cohort files for common use cases. 
The file names used are placeholders representing a BIDS-like dataset; while this structure is encouraged, it is not required.

## Segmentation Creation

Only requires one (or more) volume columns to segment. You may optionally provide some markups as well.

### Single Volume

# Detailed Cohort Specifications

A more details breakdown of the cohort specification, and how it translates to Slicer and CART's use of the case's contents, is as follows:

* `uid`: Single column
* `volume`: Any column with `volume` in its name (`volume_T1w`, `rescan_volume` etc.) is treated as a standard imaging sequence.
  * Each case must have at least one valid `volume` column entry. 
  * If multiple `volume` columns are specified, each volume will be displayed in its own column in the Slicer viewer.
  * Cases lacking an entry for a given `volume` column are ignored.
  * The first _valid_ `volume` column for each case is used as the reference volume.
* `segmentation`: Any column with `segmentation` in its name (`segmentation_deepseg`, `dr_johns_spinal_segmentation` etc.) is treated as a segmentation label, as is loaded as an overlay on top of _all_ volumes.
  * The to-be-reviewed segmentation is determined by a few criterion.
    * If the column has `primary` in its name (i.e. `primary_segmentation`, `deepseg_segmentation_primary`), it is selected as the "to-be-reviewed" segmentation, making it the default target for any corrections made.
    * If multiple `primary` columns exist, the first valid on for a given case is selected.
    * If no valid `primary` columns exist, the first valid segmentation is selected.
    * If a case lacks any valid `segmentation` column entries whatsoever, we assume you want to create the corresponding segmentation instead.
  * You do **_not_** need to specify any `segmentation` columns; doing so will assume you are creating the corresponding segmentations instead.
* `markup`: Any column with `markup` in its name is loaded as [Slicer Markup file](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/markups.html).
  * **Currently Experimental:** markups are loaded in for reference only. We cannot guarantee any consistency with how they will behave it edited, deleted, or created post-load; this task only loads markups relevant to the currently selected case, and hides those which are not.
  * Act identically to `segmentation` columns, except that they cannot be edited at all, and no "primary" markup is selected.
