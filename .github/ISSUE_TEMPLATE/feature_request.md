Thank you for opening a feature request. Please fill out the following sections to help us best understand what you would like, and how we can best approach it.

## Description

Describe the feature or change you would like to see in brief. If possible, provide each of the following as well:

### Justification

Why you want to see the feature added (i.e. "Doing X is a common requirement in Y field").

### Alternative Solutions

Any alternative solutions that might be valid, and their benefits/drawbacks if possible (i.e. "We could do Y instead, but that risks A").

### Specifics Considerations

Any specific details about the implementation that we should know about, such as pitfalls, accessibility, or other constraints (i.e. "I should be able to toggle whether Z is on or not via the config, and have it preserved through restart").

### Other Context

Anything else that could help us best to implement your proposal (i.e. "See tool [XYZ](https://zombo.com/), which has this feature implemented already")
